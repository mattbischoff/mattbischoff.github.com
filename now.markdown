This _[now page](https://nownownow.com/about)_ is [inspired by Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff). It covers the things I’m thinking, feeling, and working on, well, _right now_.

## Life 👱🏻

I’m back in New York City as of October of 2020 after spending a few months in Toronto at the beginning of the pandemic. My _wife_, [Kate Sloan](https://twitter.com/Girly_Juice) flew down to stay with me in October. [We got engaged in October](https://girlyjuice.net/im-engaged-heres-the-story/) and [married in November](https://girlyjuice.net/our-wedding-outfits/) after talking about it for a year. I miss my friends and being out and about in my city, but I’m scratching my various extrovert itches with group chats, virtual events, and FaceTime calls with friends and family.

### Feelings 🔮

I’m really [glad we won the election](https://twitter.com/mb/status/1325112439906725888) and pretty angry at the fascists who are trying to tear down American democracy. I know there’s lot more work to do to achieve the massive political change this country needs. Right now I’m advocating for and donating to causes like [Black Lives Matter], [trans rights], [abortion access], and [prison abolition].

While the COVID-19 pandemic rages on, I’m [thankful for a lot of things](https://twitter.com/mb/status/1331973312659021824), especially being housed and employed through all of this.

### Gender 🏳️‍⚧️

I [came out as nonbinary](https://twitter.com/mb/status/1150437952155242496) last year, and I’m still exploring my gender. I’ve tried a bunch of new clothes, shoes, and makeup recently and they’re helping me see myself in the mirror more as I feel internally. Being correctly gendered feels really good and being misgendered continues to suck.

### 2021 Theme: Invest 📈

Based on [The Theme System](https://www.thethemesystem.com), which I learned about through the [Cortex](http://cortex.fm) podcast, I choose a yearly theme. [This year’s theme](https://matthewbischoff.com/2021-theme-invest/) is **Invest** which means this year I aim to:

* Spend time, attention, and money on things with long-term potential. 🕰
* Build systems, relationships, and habits to last. 🏛
* Evaluate bets consistently and adjust. ⚖️

## Work 👅

My job as a Partner at [Lickability](https://lickability.com) involves leading the team, setting product direction, helping with day-to-day operations, and talking to new and existing clients about what we can do for them. At the moment, I’m pitching in some engineering on a few client projects. I’m also proud of our most recent release of [Buildwatch](https://buildwatch.app).

### Talks 🗣

This year I gave my first remote talk, _[Apps for All: Making Accessible Software](https://matthewbischoff.com/apps-for-all/)_ at [App Builders CH](https://appbuilders.ch). If you enjoyed it and you’d like me to speak at your event in 2021, [get in touch](/contact).

### Podcasts 🎙

I love listening to (and [guesting on](/about/#podcasts)) podcasts, but I’m chronically behind on my backlog of shows because I oversubscribe. Some shows I’m binging lately: [Gender Reveal](https://www.genderpodcast.com), [Do By Friday](http://dobyfriday.com), [Election Profit Makers](http://www.electionprofitmakers.com), [The Dildorks], and [You’re Wrong About](https://yourewrongabout.com).

If you’d like me to have me on your podcast, I’ve got all the time in the world at the moment and would really love that. [Shoot me an email](mailto:mb@matthewbischoff.com?subject=Podcast), and let’s do it.

### Music 🎶

Here’s a playlist of the albums that I’m listening to in heavy rotation.
