This *[now page](https://nownownow.com/about)* is [inspired by Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff). It covers the things I’m thinking, feeling, and working on, well, right now.

## Life 👱🏻

Usually, I live and work in New York City. But near the beginning of the [COVID-19 global pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019), I realized I didn’t want to be isolated alone. So, for the past few months, I’ve been living in Toronto with my incredibly gracious partner [Kate Sloan](https://twitter.com/Girly_Juice). I’m scratching my various extrovert itches with group chats, [virtual events](https://comedybar.ca/sunday_live.php), and phone calls with friends and family.

### Feelings 🔮

The global pandemic has me thinking a lot about the future—of work, of politics, and of my own life. I’ve gotten somewhat of a handle on the day-to-day rhythm and anxiety of living in this moment, but I’m looking forward to getting to the other side of this, and helping to shape what that future is.

### Gender ⚧

I [came out as nonbinary](https://twitter.com/mb/status/1150437952155242496) last July, and I’m still exploring my [gender identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity) and [expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_expression). New clothes, shoes, makeup, and ways of seeing myself and the world.

### 2020 Theme: Commit 🤝

Based on [The Theme System](https://www.thethemesystem.com), which I learned about through the [Cortex](http://cortex.fm) podcast, I choose a yearly theme. This year’s theme is **Commit** which means this year I aim to:

* Do things all the way. Finish them. Get them right. ✅
* Commit to a few things rather than half-assing many. 🧠
* Dedicate time, attention, and money to worthy projects, people, & ideas. ⏰

## Work 👅

My job as a Partner at [Lickability](https://lickability.com) involves leading the team, setting product direction, helping with day-to-day operations, and talking to new and existing clients about what we can do for them. At the moment, I’m mostly focused on making sure our employees have everything they need to work well remotely, managing the development of 2 iOS apps for clients, and readying our next app, Scorecard, for release. [Join the beta here](https://testflight.apple.com/join/bkjqS6h4).

### App Critique 🧐

Recently [re-started a video project](https://twitter.com/mb/status/1243632324329254914) I first did in 2016. The goal is to show how I evaluate the design of software with short design reviews. You can watch them as they’re released on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm5nKVoMBy49B-u868rgRCOMLVgUwskdT).

If you’d like your app design scrutinized, [fill out this form](https://matthewbischoff.typeform.com/to/RjX8si). Preference will be given to indie devs and small companies.

### Talks 🗣

Just finished a new talk called _Apps for All: Making Accessible Software_ for [App Builders CH](https://appbuilders.ch) that I’ll be presenting tomorrow in their first remote event. [Get a ticket!

## Media 💻

### Photography 📷

I’ve been focusing a bit more on photography recently. Here are the latest photos I’ve shared on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/mattb).

### Podcasts 🎙

I love listening to (and guesting on) podcasts, but I’m chronically behind on my backlog of shows because I oversubscribe. Some shows I’m binging lately: [Gender Reveal](https://www.genderpodcast.com), [Do By Friday](http://dobyfriday.com), [The Heart](https://www.theheartradio.org) (it’s back!), and [You’re Wrong About](https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/youre-wrong-about/id1380008439).

If you’d like me to have me on your podcast, I’ve got all the time in the world at the moment and would really love that. [Shoot me an email](mailto:mb@matthewbischoff.com?subject=Podcast), and let’s do it.

### Books 📚

These are the books I’m reading right now. My [notes and highlights](https://www.goodreads.com/notes/3162891-matthew-bischoff?ref=rnlp) are available on Goodreads. If you’d like to recommend a book, [send me an email](mailto:mb@matthewbischoff.com?subject=Book%20Reccomendation).

# Then

One time in 2003, I was on [an episode of Jeopardy!](https://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=3342) and lost very badly.
