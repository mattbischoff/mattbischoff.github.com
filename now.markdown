This *[now page](https://nownownow.com/about)* is [inspired by Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff). It covers the things I’m thinking, feeling, and working on, well, *right now*.

## Life 👱🏻

I’m living in New York City, and I’m fully vaccinated as of April 29! 🩹

My wife, [Kate Sloan](https://twitter.com/Girly_Juice) and I have been separated by the U.S./Canada border since April. I miss her lots, but I
’m glad she was able to get the vaccine there. 💙

I’ve been hanging out with friends and family IRL again and it's absolutely wonderful. The other day I even met a stranger in a bar and spent the night learning about them. If you're in or around NYC and wanna meet up, [let's do it](https://matthewbischoff.com/lets-hang-out/)! 👋

For fun I've been singing musical theatre tunes over on TikTok and I’m practicing card magic again. I’ll show you a trick sometime. 🃏

### Feelings 🔮

[I turned 30](https://www.instagram.com/p/CJaNlzXJMy0/) in December, and it's made me think a lot about how I spend my time and what impact I want to have on the world and the people around me. More to come on that once I have more time to think about it. 

There's so much we need to do in order achieve the massive political change this country needs. Right now I’m advocating for and donating to causes like [Black Lives Matter](https://blacklivesmatter.com), [trans rights](https://translifeline.org), [abortion access](https://abortionfunds.org), and [prison abolition](http://criticalresistance.org).

### Gender 🏳️‍⚧️

I [came out as nonbinary](https://twitter.com/mb/status/1150437952155242496) last year, and I’m still exploring my gender. I’ve tried a bunch of new clothes, shoes, and makeup recently and they’re helping me see myself in the mirror more as I feel internally. Being correctly gendered feels really good and being misgendered continues to suck, especially from people who know me and care about me.

### 2021 Theme: Invest 📈

Based on [The Theme System](https://www.thethemesystem.com), which I learned about through the [Cortex](http://cortex.fm) podcast, I choose a yearly theme. [This year’s theme](https://matthewbischoff.com/2021-theme-invest/) is **Invest** which means this year I aim to:

* Spend time, attention, and money on things with long-term potential. 🕰

* Build systems, relationships, and habits to last. 🏛

* Evaluate bets consistently and adjust. ⚖️

## Work 👅

My job as a Partner at [Lickability](https://lickability.com) involves leading the team, setting product direction, helping with day-to-day operations, and talking to new and existing clients about what we can do for them.

At the moment, I’m figuring out our hiring process for the next position we want to open, leading a few client projects, and marketing  🤫.

### Talks 🗣

Last year I gave my first remote talk, *[Apps for All: Making Accessible Software](https://matthewbischoff.com/apps-for-all/)* at [App Builders CH](https://appbuilders.ch). If you enjoyed it and you’d like me to speak at your event in 2021, [get in touch](/contact).

### Podcasts 🎙

I love listening to (and [guesting on](/about/#podcasts)) podcasts, but I’m chronically behind on my backlog of shows because I oversubscribe. Some shows I’m binging lately: [Gender Reveal](https://www.genderpodcast.com), [Do By Friday](http://dobyfriday.com), [Election Profit Makers](http://www.electionprofitmakers.com), [The Dildorks](http://thedildorks.com), and [You’re Wrong About](https://yourewrongabout.com).

If you’d like me to have me on your podcast, I’ve got all the time in the world at the moment and would really love that. [Shoot me an email](mailto:mb@matthewbischoff.com?subject=Podcast), and let’s do it.

### Music 🎶

Here’s a playlist of the albums that I’m listening to in heavy rotation.
