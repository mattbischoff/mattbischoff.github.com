This _[now page](https://nownownow.com/about)_ is [inspired by Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff). It covers the things I’m thinking, feeling, and working on, well, _right now_.

## Life 👱🏻

I’m living in New York City, and I’ll be fully vaccinated as of April, 29! 💉 

My wife, [Kate Sloan](https://twitter.com/Girly_Juice) flew down to stay with me in October but she’s gotta head back to Toronto to get vaccinated at the end of April. I’ll miss her lots.

I’m getting really excited to be able to see my friends and family soon, but until then I’m scratching my various extrovert itches with group chats, virtual events, and FaceTime calls. Feel free to [say hi](/contact).

[I turned 30](https://www.instagram.com/p/CJaNlzXJMy0/) in December and collected about some of the [lessons I’ve learned](https://matthewbischoff.com/30-lessons-from-30-years/) over the years. And my pals and I [raised $5,500 to benefit Trans Lifeline](https://secure.givelively.org/donate/trans-lifeline/matthew-bischoff-1). Best birthday ever. 🥳

Oh yeah, and I’m starting to get back into card magic. 🃏

### Feelings 🔮

I’m really [glad we won the election](https://twitter.com/mb/status/1325112439906725888) and pretty angry at the fascists who are still trying to tear down American democracy. I know there’s lot more work to do to achieve the massive political change this country needs. Right now I’m advocating for and donating to causes like [Black Lives Matter](https://blacklivesmatter.com), [trans rights](https://translifeline.org), [abortion access](https://abortionfunds.org), and [prison abolition](http://criticalresistance.org).

As we start to turn the corner on the COVID-19, I remain [thankful for a lot of things](https://twitter.com/mb/status/1331973312659021824), especially being housed and employed through all of this.

### Gender 🏳️‍⚧️

I [came out as nonbinary](https://twitter.com/mb/status/1150437952155242496) last year, and I’m still exploring my gender. I’ve tried a bunch of new clothes, shoes, and makeup recently and they’re helping me see myself in the mirror more as I feel internally. Being correctly gendered feels really good and being misgendered continues to suck, especially at work from folks outside the company and in publications quoting me.

### 2021 Theme: Invest 📈

Based on [The Theme System](https://www.thethemesystem.com), which I learned about through the [Cortex](http://cortex.fm) podcast, I choose a yearly theme. [This year’s theme](https://matthewbischoff.com/2021-theme-invest/) is **Invest** which means this year I aim to:

* Spend time, attention, and money on things with long-term potential. 🕰
* Build systems, relationships, and habits to last. 🏛
* Evaluate bets consistently and adjust. ⚖️

## Work 👅

My job as a Partner at [Lickability](https://lickability.com) involves leading the team, setting product direction, helping with day-to-day operations, and talking to new and existing clients about what we can do for them. 

At the moment, I’m figuring out our hiring process for the next position we want to open, doing annual reviews, leading a few client projects, and getting ready to ship a brand new app 🤫.

### Talks 🗣

Last year I gave my first remote talk, _[Apps for All: Making Accessible Software](https://matthewbischoff.com/apps-for-all/)_ at [App Builders CH](https://appbuilders.ch). If you enjoyed it and you’d like me to speak at your event in 2021, [get in touch](/contact).

### Podcasts 🎙

I love listening to (and [guesting on](/about/#podcasts)) podcasts, but I’m chronically behind on my backlog of shows because I oversubscribe. Some shows I’m binging lately: [Gender Reveal](https://www.genderpodcast.com), [Do By Friday](http://dobyfriday.com), [Election Profit Makers](http://www.electionprofitmakers.com), [The Dildorks](http://thedildorks.com), and [You’re Wrong About](https://yourewrongabout.com).

If you’d like me to have me on your podcast, I’ve got all the time in the world at the moment and would really love that. [Shoot me an email](mailto:mb@matthewbischoff.com?subject=Podcast), and let’s do it.

### Music 🎶

Here’s a playlist of the albums that I’m listening to in heavy rotation.

### Books 📚

These are the books I’m reading right now. My [notes and highlights](https://www.goodreads.com/notes/3162891-matthew-bischoff?ref=rnlp) are available on Goodreads. If you’d like to recommend a book, [send me an email](mailto:mb@matthewbischoff.com?subject=Book%20Reccomendation).
