This _[now page](https://nownownow.com/about)_ is [inspired by Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff). It covers the things I’m thinking, feeling, and working on, well, _right now_.

## Life 👱🏻

I’m back in New York City as of October of 2020 after spending a few months in Toronto at the beginning of the pandemic. My _wife_, [Kate Sloan](https://twitter.com/Girly_Juice) flew down to stay with me in October. [We got engaged in October](https://girlyjuice.net/im-engaged-heres-the-story/) and [married in November](https://girlyjuice.net/our-wedding-outfits/) after talking about it for a year. I miss my friends and being out and about in my city, but I’m scratching my various extrovert itches with group chats, virtual events, and FaceTime calls with friends and family.

### Feelings 🔮

I’m really [glad ](https://twitter.com/mb/status/1325112439906725888)_[we](https://twitter.com/mb/status/1325112439906725888)_[ won the election](https://twitter.com/mb/status/1325112439906725888), and I know there’s lot more work to do to achieve the massive political change this country needs. I’m [thankful for a lot of things](https://twitter.com/mb/status/1331973312659021824), especially being housed and employed through all of this.

### Gender ⚧

I [came out as nonbinary](https://twitter.com/mb/status/1150437952155242496) last year, and I’m still exploring my gender. I’ve tried a bunch of new clothes, shoes, and makeup recently and they’re helping me see myself in the mirror more as I feel internally.

### 2020 Theme: Commit 🤝

Based on [The Theme System](https://www.thethemesystem.com), which I learned about through the [Cortex](http://cortex.fm) podcast, I choose a yearly theme. This year’s theme is **Commit** which means this year I aim to:

- Do things all the way. Finish them. Get them right. ✅
- Commit to a few things rather than half-assing many. 🧠
- Dedicate time, attention, & money to worthy projects, people, & ideas. ⏰

## Work 👅

My job as a Partner at [Lickability](https://lickability.com) involves leading the team, setting product direction, helping with day-to-day operations, and talking to new and existing clients about what we can do for them. At the moment, I’m on break for the year, but I’m proud of our most recent release of [Buildwatch](https://buildwatch.app).

### Talks 🗣

This year I gave my first remote talk, _[Apps for All: Making Accessible Software](https://matthewbischoff.com/apps-for-all/)_ at [App Builders CH](https://appbuilders.ch). If you enjoyed it and you’d like me to speak at your event in 2021, [get in touch](/contact).

### Podcasts 🎙

I love listening to (and [guesting on](/about/#podcasts)) podcasts, but I’m chronically behind on my backlog of shows because I oversubscribe. Some shows I’m binging lately: [Gender Reveal](https://www.genderpodcast.com), [Do By Friday](http://dobyfriday.com), [Election Profit Makers](http://www.electionprofitmakers.com), [The Heart](https://www.theheartradio.org), and [You’re Wrong About](https://yourewrongabout.com).

If you’d like me to have me on your podcast, I’ve got all the time in the world at the moment and would really love that. [Shoot me an email](mailto:mb@matthewbischoff.com?subject=Podcast), and let’s do it.

### Books 📚

These are the books I’m reading right now. My [notes and highlights](https://www.goodreads.com/notes/3162891-matthew-bischoff?ref=rnlp) are available on Goodreads. If you’d like to recommend a book, [send me an email](mailto:mb@matthewbischoff.com?subject=Book%20Reccomendation).
