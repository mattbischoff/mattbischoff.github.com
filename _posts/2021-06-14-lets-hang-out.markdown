I’m an extrovert, and lately it’s felt so good to be able to see and meet people again that I want to do a lot more of that in the next few months.

So, if you’re in or around New York, **[let’s hang out](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSflmQAEmF-VmsRroFDmPlaKk0_3p-cNC7yZci4MLb5QzP3BUQ/viewform)**! I made a cute little form to keep things organized. Don’t be shy.
